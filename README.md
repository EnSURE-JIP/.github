## About

![EnSURE-logo"](/ensure.png)

This project addresses the need for calibrated reservoir models that are able to provide robust reservoir forecasts and uncertainty quantification. We target the challenge of efficiency of the algorithms so that calibration of model parameters can be achieved faster when new data are acquired. We target the challenge of robustness so that bias in forecasts is reduced and a more comprehensive spectrum of potential outcomes is obtained. We achieve these targets through the development of a workflow that includes model and data checking and provides greater insight. Finally, we apply the methodologies developed in this project to real field cases to ensure that the methods will be useful.

This repository holds the codes developed in the EnSURE project
